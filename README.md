# FaceMaskDetector
**Automated Face Mask Detector:** </br>
It is essential in these COVID times to ensure the safety of the people. So this Automated Face Mask Detector was done to detect whether a person is wearing face mask or not to ensure safety in public places. <br/>
The CNN algorithm produced an accuracy of 96% <br/>
In this the libraries used are <br/>
1)Tensorflow <br/>
2)Keras <br/>
3)Opencv <br/>
4)Numpy <br/>

**How to run:**<br/>
Run the file "mask_detection.ipynb" to train the model<br/>
Then run "test.py" for detection<br/>

**Sample Outputs:**<br/>
Here are some sample outputs
